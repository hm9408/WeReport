WeReport
------------

Waze-ish app that helps users report criminal activity.
Uses Google Maps to display your city and allows you to make reports on streets, whether they're suspicious or just safe.


How it works
------------

WeReport defines a color code on every street, based on the reports that have been made on them. This color code is meant to represent the most relevant data on those reports, taking into account their frequency and age.
Three colors make up this color code:
Green, for generally safe streets. These might include from good lighting conditions to police presence.
Yellow, for mildly unsafe streets. Some robberies or potentially dangerous activity was reported here. Just be cautious.
Red, for very dangerous streets. A considerable amount of dangerous activities was reported here, including, but not limited to robberies, murder, drug selling, and gang activity.
Streets without information will have their default map color.
Streets with old enough reports will have their default map color, as well. However, the user will be able to see the report log for that street.
